# Psswrd

Psswrd allows client-sided generation of cryptographically secure random passwords.

## Demonstration
A simple demonstration has been set up. It and it's source code can be found [here](http://inmomentum.io/psswrd/index.html).

## Installation

Download [psswrd.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InMomentum/Psswrd/master/dist/psswrd.js) or the minified version [psswrd.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InMomentum/Psswrd/master/dist/psswrd.min.js).

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/psswrd.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

It's easy to use Psswrd. Initiate an object and call its getRandomPassword() method. An error will thrown, if it could not generate a password.

```javascript
const psswrd = new Psswrd();
psswrd.getRandomPassword();
```

An error will thrown, if it could not generate a password.

```javascript
const psswrd = new Psswrd();

try {
    psswrd.getRandomPassword();
}
catch(e) {
    // statements to handle exception
}
```

### Configuration

You are free to override any of the default values before retrieving the password that's being generated by the object.

```javascript
const psswrd = new Psswrd({
    length: 12,
    letters: 'AaBaCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz',
    numbers: '0123456789',
    special: '!$%@#'
});

psswrd.getRandomPassword();
```

By default, Passwrd generates cryptographically secure random passwords. This can be changed (although not recommended) by overwriting the default value.

```javascript
const psswrd = new Psswrd({
    strict: false
});

psswrd.getRandomPassword();
```

## Build

Psswrd is built with gulp. Psswrd source lives in src, which gets compiled, bundled and minified into dist/psswrd.js and dist/psswrd.min.js with the help of gulp, gulp-babel, gulp-uglify and gulp-rename.

```bash
npm run build
```
